# My First Jab At 3D Modeling With Three.js

Tutorial provided by fireship.io. Never thought three.js is this much fun ðŸ˜„ I now have a brand new appreciation for 3D model artists. This stuff is NOT easy ðŸ¤¯.

[Watch the tutorial!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7AOvWpIVHU&t=781s)

To demo the app,

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Install three.js if it's not installed `npm i three`
4. Run `npm run dev`
5. Open `localhost:5173`

Not really much, this was an experiment to see how 3D rendering is done :D But I will try loading a custom 3D model I created in Vectary next!
